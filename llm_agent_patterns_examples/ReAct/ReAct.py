Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.
Action: Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.
Action: Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action: Search[High Plains]
Observation: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action: Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]
Thought: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]

Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought: The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action: Search[Milhouse]
Observation: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.
Thought: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".
Action: Lookup[named after]
Observation: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.
